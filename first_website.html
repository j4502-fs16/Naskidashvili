<p>My name is Nana Naskidashvili. I am a journalist from Georgia, the Caucasus.
I am interested in the investigative reporting and covering international news
related to conflicts and foreign policy. Now I am a graduate student at the
University of Missouri. Before joining the school, I worked on investigative
documentaries back in Georgia.</p>

<h2> Joke of the day</h2>

<p>The Georgian, American, and Russian militaries got together for a contest
  to see who could retrieve a rabbit from the forest faster than the others.</p>

  <p>The Americans brought in consultants, psychologists, and military advisors,
  then went into the forest. They talked to the rabbit for two hours and
  and persuaded him to come out.</p>

  <p>The Russians brought in helicopters and planes and bombed the forest.
  An hour later, they carried out a dead rabbit.</p>

  <p>The Georgians went into the forest, whereupon everyone heard terrible sounds
  of pommeling and beating. Ten minutes later, they came out of the forest
  with a bear, who promptly signed papers confessing he was a rabbit.</p>
