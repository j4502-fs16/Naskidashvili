<h2> Joke of the day</h2>

<p2>The Georgian, American, and Russian militaries got together for a contest
  to see who could retrieve a rabbit from the forest faster than the others.

  The Americans brought in consultants, psychologists, and military advisors,
  then went into the forest. They talked to the rabbit for two hours and
  and persuaded him to come out.

  The Russians brought in helicopters and planes and bombed the forest.
  An hour later, they carried out a dead rabbit.

  The Georgians went into the forest, whereupon everyone heard terrible sounds
  of pommeling and beating. Ten minutes later, they came out of the forest
  with a bear, who promptly signed papers confessing he was a rabbit.</p2>
